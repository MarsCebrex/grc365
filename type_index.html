  <h1>The Crow and The Pitcher</h1>

	<img src="lychee empty.png" alt="lychee image" class="lychee"/> 
	<p>A Crow, half-dead with thirst, came upon a Pitcher which had
  once been full of water; but when the Crow put its beak into the
  mouth of the Pitcher he found that only very little water was left
  in it, and that he could not reach far enough down to get at it.
  He tried, and he tried, but at last had to give up in despair.</p>
	<p class="callout"><span class="open">&ldquo;</span>Then a thought came to him, and he took a pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher.&rdquo;</p>
			<p> Then he took another pebble and dropped it into the Pitcher.
			Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher.
			Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher. 
			Then he took another pebble and dropped that into the Pitcher.
			Then he took another pebble and dropped that into 
			the Pitcher. At last, at last, he saw the water mount up near 
			him, and after casting in a few more pebbles he was able to quench 
			his thirst and save his life.</p>
